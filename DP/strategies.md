Recipe:

1. Define the subproblem

2. State the recursive relation

- Can sometimes have tabular solutions to store previous work (longestPalindrome)

- Think bottom-up when building the solution from subproblems.  you'll generally start with a 1d or 2d array
initialized to 0 or false.  Then, you'll set the base case value manually.
