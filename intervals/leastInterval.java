  n represents a constraint, so possibly constraint satisfaction problem

  basically asking how to arrange the tasks and idle time in a way that minimizes
  the amount of idle time

  -

  greedy algorithm: we want to use the char with greatest frequency first because we know
  there will probably be some amount of idle time associated with it.

  max heap: (char, frequency) tuples.  char with highest frequency will always be at root.

  -

  algorithm:

  initialize maxheap, queue, and time = 0

  get frequencies of each char.  add the frequencies to max heap.

  while the maxHeap has elements:
    increment time by 1.  

    pop the maxheap, decrement its value.  
    
    if the new value is not 0:

      add the new value to a queue along with time + n (next time this task is 
      available to be added to heap).

    peek the queue.  if peek element's time <= time, then pop it and add its value to maxheap.
 
  return time
